## This is a school project on  'Percepton Learning' and 'Supervised Machine Learning'

- Perceptron Learning
Machine learning has undergone a revolutionary change with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which presents new methods for resolving challenging issues. Neural networks have attracted a lot of attention among because of their capacity to simulate decision making processes that are similar to those of humans. A key component in this enviroment is the perceptron learning algorithim, which is a basic idea in neural network theory.

The objective of this reseach is to investigate the use of the perceptron learning algorithm in relation to logical gates, with a particular emphasis on the logical "AND" gate. This hope to learn more about the adaptability and efficiency of the perceptron in learning and computation tasks by modelling the behaviour of such simple logical functions.

- Supervised Machine Learning
The evolution of machine learning has propelled advancements in intelligent systems, empowering them to learn and make informed decisions. This study focuses on leveraging Supervised Machine Learning for the precise classification of Rose flowers. The project entails using key features such as Stem Length, Petal Length, Stem Diameter, and Bud Diameter to differentiate Apricot Rose, Coral Apricot Rose, and Red Rose.
This research is important for precision agriculture because it has the potential to completely change the way flowers are grown. Growers can optimize care regimens and allocate resources more efficiently and sustainably with accurate classification. The study emphasizes how artificial intelligence can be tailored to tackle practical problems in the floriculture industry.

The goals go beyond just assessing performance as various machine learning algorithms are will be explored. The interest is to decipher deep interest into the complex relationship between supervised machine learning and complex field of flower classification. In order to provide new insights and developments for the wider implementation of this strategy in the specialized field of floral classification, the story takes a critical look at the challenges that come with supervised machine learning.
